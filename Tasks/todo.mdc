Additional Voice stuffs:

Wait for “Listen” (or similar) Command:
Overlay appears, but does NOT start dictation.
Waits for a command like “Listen” or “I want to say something.”
Pros: Prevents accidental input, feels more like talking to an assistant.
Cons: Adds one extra step for every interaction.
Anthropomorphic/Conversational Option:
Overlay appears and says (or displays):
“Hi! What can I do for you?”
User can say:
“Listen” (to dictate a message)
“Look” / “Check this out” (to attach screenshot)
“Help” (to get help)
“Nevermind” (to cancel)
Recommendation:
If you want a more “assistant-like” feel, Option B is better.
If you want pure speed, stick with Option A.
2. Anthropomorphic Command Phrasing
Screenshot:
Accept “Look”, “Check this out”, “Screenshot”, “See this”, etc.
Dictation:
Accept “Listen”, “Take a note”, “Write this”, etc.
Cancel:
“Nevermind”, “Cancel”, “Forget it”, “Stop”, etc.
This makes the assistant feel more human and flexible.
3. Command Handling During Dictation
Commands like “send”, “clear”, “cancel” should only be recognized if:
They are the only thing said (e.g., “send”)
Or at the end of a phrase (e.g., “remind me to call John send”)
Commands like “look”, “screenshot” should only work if not in the middle of dictation (or, if you want, you can allow “add a screenshot” mid-dictation).
Do NOT trigger commands if they appear in the middle of a normal sentence.
E.g., “I want to send a screenshot to John” should not trigger “send” or “screenshot”.
4. Anything Else?
Confirmation: For destructive actions (“clear”, “cancel”), consider a quick confirmation: “Are you sure?” (optional for MVP).
Help: Always available, lists all commands.
Feedback: Visual and/or audio for every action.
Timeout: If no command is given after activation, overlay can auto-dismiss or prompt again.
5. Sample Flow (Option B: Wait for Command)
User: “Sky”
Overlay: “Hi! What can I do for you?” (shows options)
User: “Listen”
→ Overlay: “I’m listening…” (starts dictation)
User: “Remind me to call John at 5pm send”
→ Message sent, overlay closes
OR
User: “Look”
→ Screenshot attached
OR
User: “Nevermind”
→ Overlay closes
6. Implementation Plan
On hotword, show overlay and wait for a command (“listen”, “look”, “help”, “nevermind”).
Only start dictation if “listen” (or similar) is spoken.
Only allow “send”, “clear”, “cancel” during dictation, and only if at end of phrase.
Use Regex to robustly detect commands at end of phrase.
