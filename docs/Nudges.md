Contextual “Nudge” System
To truly feel like a smart assistant, Skai will offer contextual assistance when appropriate:
Screen Monitoring: With user permission, the app will run a background thread that periodically checks the active window or screen content. This could be done by capturing a screenshot or, more efficiently, using OS APIs to get the title of the active window and any text (for example, if it’s a browser, maybe read the URL or page title; if it’s a Word document, maybe get recently typed text via clipboard monitor). For a general solution, taking a screenshot and running OCR for text might be used when more detail is needed. We will throttle this (e.g. once every 30 seconds, or when a significant change is detected in window title or content).
Trigger Conditions: The system will use simple rules or ML classifiers to decide if a suggestion should be made. Examples:
User has a PDF manual open for >5 minutes → “Need help summarizing this document?”
User copies a block of text → “I can translate or explain that text if you like.”
An error dialog with certain keywords appears → “It looks like an error occurred. Want me to search for solutions?”
The user hasn’t interacted for a while but an upcoming meeting is in calendar → a gentle reminder might appear.
Generating Suggestions: For straightforward cases, the suggestion can be canned (pre-defined). For more complex scenarios, Skai can feed the context to GPT-4 or a smaller model with a prompt like “Given this situation [context], suggest a helpful tip to the user.” Because API calls cost money, we will use this sparingly. We might employ a cheap local model or heuristic to filter whether to involve GPT. For instance, only if certain keywords or patterns are present will we ask GPT to craft a suggestion; otherwise, do nothing.
Notification UI: Suggestions will appear as a small popup (perhaps above the tray icon or as a toast notification) with a short message. The user can click it to open Skai for more info or dismiss it. The tone of these nudges will be humble and optional (we do not want Clippy-level annoyance). There will also be a “Do not show again” or master switch for users who prefer zero interruptions.
Example: User is writing an email that includes phrases like “attached report” but they haven’t attached anything yet – Skai could notice the word “attached” and no file attached (if it can read the email client’s state or at least the text) and nudge: “Don’t forget to attach your file 🙂. Need help finding it?” – offering to search the system for the likely file if asked.
Technically, implementing this will involve integration with Windows APIs for window management and possibly using libraries for OCR as mentioned. The key is keeping it lightweight – it should not significantly consume CPU or network in the background. It could even run at lower priority to avoid interfering with user’s system performance.
