Windows Client Application (UI/UX)
The client is a native Windows desktop application responsible for all user interaction:
UI Overlay: A pop-up chat window that appears near the mouse cursor when activated. This is a borderless, lightly transparent window (stylable via WPF/WinUI XAML) that contains the conversation UI. It should smoothly animate into view to avoid jarring the user. When pinned, it stays on top; otherwise, it auto-hides when focus is lost.
Chat Interface: Inside the overlay is a minimal chat bubble UI: a text input box (for typing queries), a microphone icon (to toggle voice listening), and an area to display the AI’s response (which can expand as needed). The design will account for multi-turn conversations, e.g. showing the last few exchanges or allowing scrolling through history. Rich text (markdown support for code, lists, etc.) should be enabled for answers.
System Tray Icon: The application runs in the background, shown by an icon in the Windows tray. Clicking it opens a full chat window – a larger interface showing the complete conversation history, ability to copy answers, regenerate answers, and a button to start a new chat (clearing context). This window is also where settings can be accessed (e.g. toggling vision/voice features, login status, etc.). The tray icon also provides quick actions on right-click (like “Ask a question” which just focuses the overlay, or “Quit”).
Global Hotkey Listener: The app registers Ctrl+Shift+Space as a system-wide hotkey on startup. This is done via the Windows API or a library to capture key events even when other apps are focused. If the key is pressed, the client distinguishes a tap vs hold:
Tap: Show the chat overlay near cursor and focus the text box for input.
Hold >0.5s: Begin capturing microphone audio for voice input (visual feedback like changing the overlay glow/color to indicate listening). Releasing the keys ends voice capture and triggers transcription processing.
Voice Capture UI: When in voice mode, the overlay might show a subtle waveform or “Listening…” indicator. The user can also cancel voice by pressing Esc or clicking an X.
Error Handling & States: The UI should handle cases like “No internet connection” (e.g. display a message if API calls fail), or “Listening… (transcribing)” intermediate state, etc., to keep the user informed.
